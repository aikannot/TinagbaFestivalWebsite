                <p>In my hometown in Iriga City, Philippines we celebrated Tinagba Festival. Tinagba came from the word "tagba" which means "first harvest offering". Tinagba Festival is a yearly celebration in our city, during the month of February. It is the reenactment of an old pagan ritual of offering the best produce of the land. The festival originally started from the rituals of the earliest Bicolanos who offered their harvest to their Gods a way of thanksgiving and requesting for a more abundant harvest. </p>

                <p>This hugely popular and all-out fun festival is held every February in Iriga City, at the province of Camarines Sur in the Philippines. Locals from all walks of life come together to celebrate the first harvest of the year. Expect to see street dancing, elaborate processions, beauty contests and sports competitions to name a few. Men and women alike don their colourful traditional garments and parade their creatively decorated bull carts that are characteristic of this festival. The festival’s roots stem from Pagan ritualism. The earliest Bicolans, a largely agricultural and rural community, would offer their harvest to the gods, as a way of thanking them and asking for the next harvest to be even more abundant.  </p>

                <p>The first Tinagba Festival was launched in 1974. It was developed by Jose Calleja Reyes, a lawyer and a businessman. The fest was conceptualized as a promotion of Iriga as a tourist destination (and in the process Reyes’ entrepreneurial initiatives), an expression of veneration to Our Lady of Lourdes, and a celebration of the Bicolano customs and tradition. </p>
